It allows to discriminate covers that have a different reflective behavior between two or more bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\nThe NDVI is one of the most used when estimating the quantity, quality and development of the vegetation. It is calculated by means of visible and near infrared light reflected by the vegetation. The calculation of this index is done with reflectivities, but when it is not necessary to grant a physical value to the results, the digital levels are used directly.\n\n\nThe following expression is used:\n\n\n\n\n\nNDVI= (IRC-R))/(IRC+R)\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere: \nIRC\n is the \nnear infrared\n response and \nR\n is the response in \nred\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe NDVI values vary between -1 and 1.

It allows to discriminate covers that have a different reflective behavior between two or more bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The NDVI is one of the most used when estimating the quantity, quality and development of the vegetation. It is calculated by means of visible and near infrared light reflected by the vegetation. The calculation of this index is done with reflectivities, but when it is not necessary to grant a physical value to the results, the digital levels are used directly.  The following expression is used:   NDVI= (IRC-R))/(IRC+R)   where:  IRC  is the  near infrared  response and  R  is the response in  red .  \nThe NDVI values vary between -1 and 1. The following are the approximate values of the NDVI for the different types of covers, which will serve to establish the classification thresholds:   NO VEGETATION     Water  Beach  Roads  Paths  Buildings       0   0.05   0.10   0.15   0.10     VEGETATION     Burned area  Dunes  Grass  Wooded  Golf course       0.10  0.10 - 0.20  0.20 - 0.30  0.30 - 0.40  0.50     The vegetation index has been used as an improvement of the classification obtained in the classification process.

            "text": "Improvements\n\n\n\n\nWe are aware that there is no automatic process for a perfect LiDAR classification.\n\n\nTechnology also has its limitations. As a result of the capture procedure itself, or because of the behavior that some elements offer when reflecting laser light, we have found some cases or areas in which we believe it is convenient to intervene in a more specific way.\n\n\nIn the design of our processing we have tried to improve the quality of the classification as far as possible, while reducing to the minimum those areas that require a personalized treatment.\n\n\nIn order to know the nature of these problems and in order to detect more easily those cases in which they occur, we expose below the casuistry that generates them, pointing to a solution:\n\n\n\n\n\nNDVI\n\n\n\n\nIn Lidar classification processes, the reflectivity values of some forest formations with dense and of uniform height, are often interpreted as buildings.\n\n\nTo avoid this confusion, one of the procedures when RGB + Ir information is available is to calculate the \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index\n (NDVI) for each of the cloud points.\n\n\nBased on this information and taking into account the number of echoes in each area, it is necessary to determine whether the LiDAR response corresponds to a vegetation area or not.\n\n\nThis procedure offers very good results in the classification, especially in those areas where there are RGB + Ir thresholds that allow the calculation of sufficiently discriminatory NDVI values.\n\n\nHowever, in many cases, there are disturbances of the signal that produce a decrease in the NDVI value:\n\n\n\n\nContaminaci\u00f3n por nubes.\n\n\nCloud pollution.\n\n\nEffects due to the geometry of the observation (observation outside the nadir).\n\n\nEffects produced by lighting (shadows).\n\n\nWeather conditions.\n\n\n\n\nAs a consequence, the LiDAR response is strongly conditioned by aspects such as: the time of the shot, the atmospheric conditions, the solar position, the angle of vision and the width of the sensor bands, the slope and exposure of the relief, the type of vegetation, as well as its phenological and physiological condition.\n\n\nParticularly in mountainous reliefs, the measured radiance recorded by a sensor from a ground cover on a shaded exposure slope (hidden from the sun), may be considerably smaller, than that measured from the same ground cover located on a sun exposure slope (exposed to the sun).\n\n\nThis make the calculation of the NDVI vegetational parameter difficult, because the spectral behavior of the vegetation is altered by the presence of shadows (Ria\u00f1o et al 2003, Eastman 2006), resulting in that the response of the vegetation affected by shades differs a lot from that of the illuminated vegetation, in spectral terms.\n\n\nIn the following images you can see the effects of this circumstance in the classification, checking the strong correlation that exists between the shadow areas of the image and the points wrongly classified with the value \ntype 6\n (Building), represented in pink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve the initial results of the classification in these areas, it is necessary to act on the points already classified as Buildings. The NDVI threshold is readjusted, considering at the same time the elevation of the points analyzed, the number of echoes in each zone and the intensity of the signal.\n\n\nThe result of this new revision can be seen in the following image, in which you can visually verify that the problems detected in the previous phase have been corrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouses\n\n\n\nWe have seen that the results of automatic classification in industrial areas are quite limited, possibly due to the complexity of the elements (corrugated surfaces, roofs where objects exist on the roof), the construction material of the roofs (metal surfaces or highly reflective ones), as well as the proximity between constructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the inherent problems of reflectivity, it is necessary to take into account that industrial or agricultural warehouses that are located in isolated areas are not classified correctly, since there is a minimum area of polygon in SIOSE.

To avoid this confusion, one of the procedures when RGB + Ir information is available is to calculate the  Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  (NDVI) for each of the cloud points.  Based on this information and taking into account the number of echoes in each area, it is necessary to determine whether the LiDAR response corresponds to a vegetation area or not.  This procedure offers very good results in the classification, especially in those areas where there are RGB + Ir thresholds that allow the calculation of sufficiently discriminatory NDVI values.  However, in many cases, there are disturbances of the signal that produce a decrease in the NDVI value:   Contaminaci\u00f3n por nubes.  Cloud pollution.

As a consequence, the LiDAR response is strongly conditioned by aspects such as: the time of the shot, the atmospheric conditions, the solar position, the angle of vision and the width of the sensor bands, the slope and exposure of the relief, the type of vegetation, as well as its phenological and physiological condition.  Particularly in mountainous reliefs, the measured radiance recorded by a sensor from a ground cover on a shaded exposure slope (hidden from the sun), may be considerably smaller, than that measured from the same ground cover located on a sun exposure slope (exposed to the sun).
